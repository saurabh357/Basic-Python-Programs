Sequence Data Type:-

List - Mutable
Tuple - Immutable
Methods- len(),min(),max()

The Difference between List and Tuple -

Mutable - We can do changes in list 

Immutable - We can't do any changes in tuple

Dictionary Data Type:-
Pair of Key and Value
It is not an Ordered Collection.
To access Values in Dictionary we can use get() Method.(Key)

Methods- len(),min(),max(),del(),clear(),pop()

Example: Saurabh ={'Age':22,'dob-month':8,'profession':'Developer'}
In this the Key is Immutable we can't do any changes in Key and A number ,List ,Tuple can be use as an Key except List.
